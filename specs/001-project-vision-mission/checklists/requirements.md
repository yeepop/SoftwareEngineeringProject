# Specification Quality Checklist: 貓狗領養平台

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Feature**: ../001-project-vision-mission/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Validation Summary

All checklist items were reviewed against the spec and marked as passing. Specific notes:

- Acceptance criteria were added and mapped to each functional requirement (section "Acceptance Criteria for Functional Requirements").
- Assumptions and out-of-scope sections were added to clearly bound scope.
- If reviewers want more granular acceptance tests (e.g., exact email content, UX microcopy), recommend adding them in a follow-up `/speckit.plan` step.
