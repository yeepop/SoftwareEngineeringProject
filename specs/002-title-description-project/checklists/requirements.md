# Specification Quality Checklist: 貓狗領養平台 — 規格更新

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

- PASS: The spec contains prioritized user stories (P1/P2) with acceptance scenarios and edge cases.
- PASS: Requirements are written as testable FRs and map clearly to user stories.
- PASS: All previous [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were resolved per user decisions.
- PARTIAL: "Feature meets measurable outcomes" — SC-001..SC-004 are measurable and present. SC-005 (客服機器人準確率) intentionally set N/A per your choice; mark as TODO if you later want a target.

## Suggested next actions

1. If you want a stakeholder-friendly one-page summary, I can generate it from this spec.
2. If you're ready for planning, run `/speckit.plan` (I can generate an initial backlog with acceptance tests).
3. If you want the spec cleaned further (e.g., separate acceptance tests per FR), I can expand those.

Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` where applicable.
